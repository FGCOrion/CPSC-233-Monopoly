Game Instructions

Player 1 will always roll first.
Press the "Roll Die" button in the middle of the screen to begin play.
If you land on an unowned property you will be prompted to purchase it.
If you would like to purchase press “Yes", if you would not like to purchase press “No”.
After your decision is made and you have made your selection, play will turn to the second player.
Repeat the above steps until one player owns the majority of the board (with no spaces left) or until 
one player runs out of money.

There are more than just property spaces available, there are also chance spaces, where you randomly pay money to the bank
or are paid money from the bank, aswell as tax spaces, which require you to pay $100 to the bank, and the "go to jail" 
space. When you land on these spaces, or a space that is owned by your opponent, no action is required by the user. Money will automatically be deposited or withdrawn from your total, and your avatar will automatically move for you.
